# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm (you can install npm by running the following command on the command line: `npm install -g npm`.
You have a basic understanding of React and Tailwind.
You have a GitHub account and are familiar with Git commands.

# Installation
## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;React.js Installation
Install Node.js: React.js is built on top of Node.js, so the first step is to install Node.js on your system. You can download the installer from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Create a new React app: Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new React app using the create-react-app command. Open your terminal and type the following command: npx create-react-app my-app

Start the development server: Once the app is created, navigate into the app directory and start the development server by running npm start. This will launch a local development server and open the app in your default web browser.

Start coding: Now that your app is set up and running, you can start coding your React components and building your app.

## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailwind CSS Installation
Install Tailwind CSS: You can install Tailwind CSS via npm by running the following command in your terminal: npm install tailwindcss

Create a Tailwind configuration file: To customize the default styles provided by Tailwind, you'll need to create a configuration file. Run the following command in your terminal: npx tailwindcss init

Configure your CSS: Now that you have a configuration file, you can use Tailwind CSS classes in your CSS file. You can either create a new CSS file and import Tailwind CSS, or you can add Tailwind CSS directly to your existing CSS file.

Compile your CSS: Finally, you'll need to compile your CSS file so that your Tailwind styles are applied to your HTML. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: npx tailwindcss-cli build path/to/input.css -o path/to/output.css

Link your CSS file: Once your CSS file is compiled, you can link it to your HTML file by adding a link tag in the head section of your HTML file.
